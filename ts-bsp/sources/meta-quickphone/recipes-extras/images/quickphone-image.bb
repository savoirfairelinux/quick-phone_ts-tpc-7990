# Work around an issue in Technologic System's layer. `IMAGE_INSTALL +=` is used
# in tsimx6.conf, which is a machine file. This is wrong as machine files should
# use MACHINE_{ESSENTIAL,}_EXTRA_{RDEPENDS,RRECOMMENDS} to install
# machine-specific packages, and using `+=` to modify IMAGE_INSTALL is
# discouraged because it ends up in unexpected situations. In our case,
# packagegroup-base ended up not being installed, and VPU firmwares were missing
# from the final image. So to work around that, we assign a new value to
# IMAGE_INSTALL
